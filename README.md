## Problem Statement

I'm having two NextJS Apps with Tailwind setup.  
For not duplicating the Tailwind configuration, I created a lib `tailwind-config` and imported it in both apps.  

The problem is, it can't be imported as `@nextjs-tester/tailwind-config`  

The error is:  

`Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@nextjs-tester/tailwind-config' in '...'`

## Solution

For me it seems more a quick fix and workaround than a solution.  
1. I added in both nextjs apps `project.json` files:  
`"dependsOn": [{ "target": "build", "projects": "tailwind-config" }],`
2. Therefore the `tailwind-config` lib is built before the nextjs apps.
3. Using the require on the dist-folder of the lib, it can be imported in the nextjs apps:  
`const myPreset = require('../../dist/libs/tailwind-config');`

## Start the development server

To start the development server run 

- `nx serve nextjs-tester`
- `nx serve my-second-app`

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!
